# Day 7: Hangman Game with Python Functions, Indentation, and While Loops

## Overview
On day 7 of my 100-days-of-python course, I delved into Python Functions, Indentation, and While Loops to create a simple yet engaging Hangman game.

## Concepts Covered
- Functions: I learned how to define and utilize functions to modularize my code and enhance readability.
- Indentation: Understanding the significance of indentation in Python for defining blocks of code within functions, loops, and conditional statements.
- While Loops: Leveraging while loops to repeatedly execute sections of code until a specific condition is met.

## Hangman Game
The Hangman game is an interactive word-guessing game where the player attempts to guess a hidden word letter by letter. With each incorrect guess, a part of the hangman is drawn until the player guesses the word correctly or runs out of attempts.
