#Day 4: Randomisation, Lists, and Nested Lists

### Overview
On this day, I explored the concepts of randomisation, lists, and nested lists in Python. I learned how to generate random numbers and how to create and manipulate lists and nested lists.

## 1. Randomisation
Randomisation is a powerful concept in programming. In Python, the `random` module provides functionality for generating random numbers, which can be used to add unpredictability to programs.

## 2. Lists and Nested Lists
Lists are a type of data structure in Python that can hold multiple items in a single variable. Lists can also contain other lists, which are known as nested lists. They are useful for organizing and storing related sets of information.

## Final Project - Rock, Paper, Scissors
For the final project, I created a simple version of the game Rock, Paper, Scissors. This project incorporated the use of randomisation to determine the computer's choice, and lists to store the possible choices (rock, paper, scissors).
