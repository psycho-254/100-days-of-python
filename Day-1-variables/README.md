# Day 1: Python Bootcamp

## Overview

On the first day of the Python Bootcamp, I learned the basics of Python programming. I got familiar with the `print` and `input` functions and understood how to use variables.

## Project: Band Name Generator

I applied what I learned by building a Band Name Generator. This program takes user input and generates a creative band name.
