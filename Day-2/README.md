On day 2 of the 100 Days of Python course, I learnt the following concepts:

- Data types: I learnt how to use and convert different types of data, such as integers, floats, strings, and booleans.
- BMI calculator: I learnt how to use arithmetic operators, input() function, and print() function to calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) from weight and height.
- Your life in weeks: I learnt how to use variables, f-Strings, and comments to create a program that tells me how many days, weeks, and months I have left if I live until 90 years old.
- Tip calculator: I learnt how to use round() function, Google, and GitHub to create a tip calculator that splits the bill among people.
