# Day 3: Control Flow and Logical Operators

## Overview
On Day 3, I delved into the world of control flow with if, else, and elif statements. I learned how to guide my program's execution based on different conditions and how to make complex decisions using nested if statements.

## Concepts Learned
- **Control Flow with if, else, and Conditional Operators**: I learned how to use if and else statements to control the flow of my program based on certain conditions.
- **Nested if and elif statements**: I discovered how to use nested if and elif statements to check for multiple conditions and make decisions accordingly.
- **Logical Operators**: I explored how to use logical operators to combine conditional statements. I learned about:
    - **A and B**: Both conditions have to be true, otherwise the whole statement evaluates to false.
    - **C or D**: One condition has to be true.
    - **not E**: The statement is true if E is not true.

## Final Project: Treasure Island
For the final project, I created my own "Choose Your Own Adventure" game. I used if, else, and elif statements to lay out the logic and the story's path in my program. It was a fun and challenging way to apply what I learned about control flow and logical operators.
