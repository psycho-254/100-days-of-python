# Day 5: Python For Loops, Range Function, and Password Generator

## Overview
On this day, I explored the concepts of Python for loops, the range function, and how to use these concepts to create a password generator.

1. Python For Loops
For loops in Python are used for iterating over a sequence (like a list, tuple, dictionary, set, or string) or other iterable objects. Iterating over a sequence is called traversal.

2. Range Function 
The range() function returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 by default, and increments by 1 (also by default), and stops before a specified number.

3. Final Project - Password Generator
For the final project, I created a Python script for a password generator. This project incorporated the use of Python for loops and the range function to generate a password that includes a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols in no particular order.
